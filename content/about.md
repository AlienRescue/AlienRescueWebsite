id = "about"
+++

Alien Rescue team consists of a group of graduate students working collaboratively under the supervision and guidance of [Dr. Min Liu](https://www.edb.utexas.edu/minliu/) and  [Dr. Lucas Horton](/team) at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu). Dr. Liu directs and supervises all aspects of the project (design, development, implementation, and research) and Dr. Horton provides guidance on the design and technical aspects of the project. Harnessing students’ diverse talents and ideas is a major characteristic of the design and development process. Students’ engagement in the project is largely driven by their interests in creating a quality technology program to enhance learning while developing multimedia production and research competencies. As the program evolves from one version to another, team members’ skills also progress and reflect current industry best practices and trends. This process has provided opportunities for students to prepare for future careers as multimedia designers and developers, instructional technologists, and educational researchers. If you are interested in joining the team, please contact [Dr. Min Liu](/team).

## History and Awards 

The development of Alien Rescue began as a cooperative venture among several units at [the University of Texas at Austin (UT)](https://www.utexas.edu) in response to a lack of quality research-based learning software. Since conception in 1997, the program has progressed from a prototype in 1998 to version 2.1 (created in Macromedia Director and delivered on CD-ROM) in 2001, to version 3.2 (created using the Torque Game Engine) in 2008, to a web-based version (created in the Unity game engine) in 2012 to the new WebGL version delivered entirely online in 2017.

The design and development of Alien Recue is primarily driven by team members’ interests in producing a high-quality learning environment while learning multimedia production skills and by a desire among faculty mentors to support students in preparing for future careers. While a small amount of funding has been used to support some development work, purchase software, provide teacher training, and provide server space, development is largely supported by the time and effort of the students and faculty.

Alien Rescue has received funding from places such as  KDK-Harman Foundation, [ESA Foundation](http://www.esafoundation.org), [Texas Space Grant Consortium](http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu), American Honda Foundation, Dell Foundation, NASA Space Telescope Science Institute, Tyco Foundation, Verizon Foundation, GTE Foundation, and Motorola Foundation; as well as several units at the University of Texas at Austin including the Division of Instructional Innovation and Assessment, College of Education, University Research Institute grants, and the Charles A. Dana Center.
