Alien Rescue is designed for sixth-grade space science to use in about fifteen 50-minute class sessions. It’s aligned with [National Science Standards](https://www.edb.utexas.edu/minliu/teacher_portal/documents/AlienRescueNationalStandards.pdf) and [Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)](https://www.edb.utexas.edu/minliu/teacher_portal/documents/TEKS_AlienRescue.pdf). As an open environment, there is no one ‘correct’ strategy to use Alien Rescue. It encourages students to freely discover, explore, and make mistakes. We also provide [suggested lesson plans](https://www.edb.utexas.edu/minliu/teacher_portal/documents/Lesson%20plans.pdf) in a comprehensive teacher's manual.
