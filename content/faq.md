Alien Rescue team consists of a group of graduate students working collaboratively under the supervision and guidance of Dr. Min Liu and  Dr. Lucas Horton at the University of Texas at Austin. Dr. Liu directs and supervises all aspects of the project (design, development, implementation, and research) and Dr. Horton provides guidance on the design and technical aspects of the project. Harnessing students’ diverse talents and ideas is a major characteristic of the design and development process. Students’ engagement in the project is largely driven by their interests in creating a quality technology program to enhance learning while developing multimedia production and research competencies. As the program evolves from one version to another, team members’ skills also progress and reflect current industry best practices and trends. This process has provided opportunities for students to prepare for future careers as multimedia designers and developers, instructional technologists, and educational researchers. If you are interested in joining the team, please contact Dr. Min Liu.
