The development of Alien Rescue is guided by a Design-Based Research framework (The Design-Based Research Collective, 2003) and research is an integral part of the development and is an ongoing effort by the R&D team. At each step of the development process, classroom based research is conducted to see how students use various features of the program and what teachers think of the new features. Program features/tools that are shown to be effective through research has been incorporated into the core of the Alien Rescue and disseminated to schools. Here are the research papers completed so far. This list is growing as we continue conducting studies with Alien Rescue.
